.Sh NAME
.Nm acpi_hidd
.Nd ACPI human interface device subsystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device acpi_hidd"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides the human interface device features of the ACPI module, in particular
brightness and media control keyboard support.
.Pp
The driver has
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr devd 8
interfaces; the 
.Xr sysctl 8
interface allows inspection and control of the screen brightness, and the
.Xr devd 8
interface provides notifications about keypresses that do
not have support for their functionality built into the driver (such as the media keys).
.Pp
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.acpi.hidd.brightness
The current brightness of the screen; if set, changes the brightness.
.El
.Pp
The brightness control uses the ACPI BIOS in the same way as the
.Xr acpi_video 4
driver, and the effect of setting it to a particular value in either driver is
identical.
.Sh NOTIFICATIONS
Notifications are passed to userland via
.Xr devd 8
- see
.Pa /etc/devd.conf
and
.Xr devd.conf 5
for examples.
The
.Nm
driver sends events with the following attributes:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "subsystem" -compact
.It system
.Li ACPI
.It subsystem
.Li HIDD
.It type
\_SB_.HID
.It notify
An integer assigned to the key by the ACPI Bios.  To determine what integers
are associated with which keys, set \fI hw.acpi.verbose\fP,
press the keys, and examine the system log.
.El
.Sh BUGS
The collection of key codes is very small at this time, comprising only the two that are
present on the GPD MicroPC.  This does not prevent use of the driver with
.Xr devd 8 ,
but contributions from users will make the driver more useful.  Inside the
driver you'll find a list of key codes and the keys they represent.  Add your
computer's codes to this list and leave your additions, the make, and model of your
computer as an issue at
