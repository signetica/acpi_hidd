.Sh NAME
.Nm acpi_hidd
.Nd ACPI human interface device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device acpi_hidd"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
kernel module provides driver services for ACPI HIDD
hardware, in particular brightness and media control keyboard support.
.Pp
The driver has
.Xr devd 8 ,
.Xr evdev 4 ,
and
.Xr sysctl 8
interfaces; the 
.Xr sysctl 8
interface allows inspection and control of the screen brightness, the
.Xr evdev 4
interface provides a mechanism for applications to directly receive keystrokes
corresponding to ACPI events, and the
.Xr devd 8
interface provides a way to have userland programs run when ACPI keys are pressed.
.Pp
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.acpi.hidd.brightness
The current brightness of the screen; when written, changes the brightness.
.Pp
The brightness control is performed using the ACPI BIOS in the same way as the
.Xr acpi_video 4
driver, and the effect of setting it to a particular value in either driver is
identical.
.It Va hw.acpi.hidd.brightness_keycontrol

When set, the keyboard brightness control keys directly increase or decrease
the screen brightness.  When cleared, the keys only generate
.Xr evdev 4
and
.Xr devd 8
events, permitting the windowing system or user software to manage the brightness.  This
variable is writable by any user or program, so it may be changed in an
.Em .xinit
script or as otherwise needed.
.It Va hw.acpi.hidd.brightness_keycontrol_unlock
When cleared,
.Em hw.acpi.hidd.brightness_keycontrol
is immutable.  It may be set in
.Em /etc/sysctl.conf
on systems (such as
laptops) when appropriate.  By default this variable is cleared.
.El
.Sh NOTIFICATIONS
Notifications are passed to userland via
.Xr devd 8
- see
.Pa /etc/devd.conf
and
.Xr devd.conf 5
for examples.
When an ACPI key is pressed, the
.Nm
driver sends events with the following attributes:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "subsystem" -compact
.It system
.Li ACPI
.It subsystem
.Li HIDD
.It type
\\_SB_.HID
.It notify
An integer assigned to the key by the ACPI BIOS.  To determine what integers
are associated with which keys, set \fI hw.acpi.verbose\fP,
press the keys, and examine the system log.
.El
.Pp
If
.Em hw.acpi.hidd.brightness_keycontrol
is set, the brightness control keys will instead generate events with the
following attributes:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "subsystem" -compact
.It system
.Li ACPI
.It subsystem
.Li Video
.It type
brightness
.It notify
An integer corresponding to the new value of
.Em hw.acpi.hidd.brightness .
.El
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
only manages the ACPI BIOS's primary monitor's brightness.  Use
.Xr acpi_video 4
and the
.Xr evdev 4
or
.Xr devd 8
interfaces to manage other displays.
.Pp
The
.Xr acpi_video 4
driver assumes that nothing else changes the ACPI BIOS brightness, and uses a
cached value instead of asking the ACPI BIOS before reporting it through its
.Xr sysctl 8 .
To avoid confusion, when a system such as a window manager is managing the screen
brightness, set
\fIhw.acpi.hidd.brightness_keycontrol\fP=0,
and do not write directly to
.Em hw.acpi.hidd.brightness
to adjust the brightness.
.Pp
The collection of key codes is very small at this time, comprising only the two that are
present on the GPD MicroPC.  This does not prevent use of the driver with
.Xr devd 8 ,
but contributions from users will make the
.Xr  evdev 4
interface more useful.
Submit your computer's key/code pairs and its make and model as an issue at
\fIhttps://github.com/signetica/acpi_hidd\fP.
More detailed instructions are in the repository.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
// HIDD keycodes for GPD MicroPC
#define ACPI_NOTIFY_HIDD_BRIGHTNESS_UP      0x13
#define ACPI_NOTIFY_HIDD_BRIGHTNESS_DOWN    0x14
