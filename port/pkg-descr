The acpi_hidd kernel module provides driver services for ACPI HIDD
notifications, in particular brightness and media control keyboard support.

The driver has sysctl(8) and devd(8) interfaces; the sysctl(8) interface
allows inspection and control of the screen brightness, and the devd(8)
interface provides notifications about keypresses that do not have support for
their functionality built into the driver (such as the media keys).
