The acpi_hidd kernel module provides driver services for ACPI HIDD
hardware, in particular brightness and media control keyboard support.

The driver has devd(8), evdev(4), and sysctl(8) interfaces; the sysctl(8)
interface allows inspection and control of the screen brightness, the evdev(4)
interface allows applications to directly receive keystrokes corresponding to
ACPI events, and the devd(8) interface provides a way to have userland
programs run when ACPI keys are pressed.
